# ESC/POS testing
This repository holds my work trying to get the AP1400 panel printer/Pipsta to work nicely with python, **and is not intended for production code**

`pipsta-constants.py` defines various useful variables for working with the printer

`pipsta-image.py` is my implementation of Single Dot Line (SDL) image printing

both of these files will move to [webhook-escpos](https://github.com/Diacius/webhook-escpos), my main project as I integrate them!
